                            I would like to increase my technical know-how as a Product Manager and learn something new during the COVID19 lockdown.

                            I'm looking for a career change in my life therefore I decided to take the course at Wild Code School. 
                            The experience I'm having with this course: I think it is a good choice. My advice to you is to work hard and code much. 
                            My future plan is to work remotely as a programmer for a company or as a freelancer because I would like to travel around Europe 
                            and around the world.

                            It´s been great so far, with a good learning environment, good colleagues and a learning curve that makes you think that you can 
                            just trust the system, even when you think is too hard and you didn´t get it, in two days you will learn another thing and when 
                            you suddenly realize, you know so much more now. My advice will be, Keep the motivation high, don´t doubt yourself ( at some point you will
                             , but thats fine) ans always keep going, with positive energy. In the end the result will surprise you.

                            At some point, I saw if I want to be a developer, I need to professionalize myself. After a little search, I decided to start this course for some reasons: 
                            the first one is the technologies we study, for me is the most demanded in the job market, another purpose where the learning time you will have in a five-month 
                            Bootcamp, and the last reason was the possibility to work with a real client in a real project.

                            Career change? Of course, this course allows you to learn a lot of necessary tools to work as a developer, like agile methodologies, 
                            git manage versions, take care of the customer needs, work in a group.

                            For me, the essential part is patient, at the first moment, you might have the feeling that you are lost, or you will not be able to work as a developer, but with 
                            constancy and dedication, you will find yourself doing huge things in a short period, and this is so satisfying.

                            Experience with WCS:
                            One of the things I am glad to decide study in WCS where our learning process, they give us a whole point of view of how to be a developer, the technologies and what are the most important.
                            Also, they teach us the most modern technics in the language that we use (like Context of Hooks in react), and this is an excellent asset for the future. Another important thing was the team spirit we developed doing hackathons and other activities.
